{\color{dbluecolor}There are \ref{last} problems. Turn your solutions in Friday, October
5, 2012 in class.  You may work with other people and can find the
\LaTeX{} of this file at \url{http://wstein.org/edu/2011/581g/hw/}.
Reminder: I have office hours 1:00pm-2:30pm on Wednesdays in Padelford
C423.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $f(x) \in \Q[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial, and let $\alpha$ be a root of $f$.
Prove that the set of polynomial expressions in $\alpha$ of degree at most $\deg(f)-1$ 
is a field.  As I explained in class, the only thing that is not obvious is that
every nonzero element has an inverse, so that is the only thing you need to prove 
in giving your solution to this problem.   \hint{Consider
a nonzero $\beta = \sum_{i=0}^{\deg(f)-1} a_i \alpha^i$ and let $g(x) = \sum a_i x^i$,
then use the extended Euclidean algorithm to show there exists $h(x),m(x)\in \Q[x]$ 
with $h(x)f(x)+ m(x)g(x) = 1$.}

\item Prove that the following additive abelian groups are not finitely generated:
$$\Q,\, \Q/\Z,\, \R,\, (\Z/7\Z)^{\infty},$$ (this last group is a
  countably-infinite dimensional vector space over the field of
  cardinality $7$).  \hint{One trick -- if a nonzero group is {\em
      divisible}, then it can't be finitely generated.}

\item\label{last} Let $A$ be the matrix 
$$A=\left(\begin{array}{rrr}
0 & 7 & 1 \\
0 & -1 & 1 \\
-12 & 0 & 4
\end{array}\right).$$
Compute the Smith normal form of $A$ and the cokernel of the map $\Z^3\to \Z^3$ defined by
$v\mapsto Av$.  Do the same for the matrix 
$$B=\left(\begin{array}{rr}
0 & 6 \\
-1 & 7 \\
-1 & -3
\end{array}\right)$$


\end{enumerate}
